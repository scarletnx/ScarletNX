"""A nightly's title and notes: the downloads by system, with their sizes and how to run them, what changed since the
previous nightly, and where the source is, which the GPL asks for beside the binaries. scripts/publish-builds.py takes
them for the nightlies of the nightly repository and a version's release, and the downloads and the source for a pull
request's builds.

The changes are the checkout's history from the commit the previous nightly was built from to the one built, left out
without it or when it is not an ancestor. The notes link the built commit first, which is where the next nightly finds
it. Each change links its pull request or commit in the repository: a bare #N in another repository's release would
name that repository's own.
