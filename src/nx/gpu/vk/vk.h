/* Vulkan renderer: shared state and the interfaces between its parts. Functions are loaded through volk from the
   loader the window backend gives (SDL's), or from libvulkan itself in headless runs (vk_init), so nothing links
   against a Vulkan library.

   device.c    instance, device, queues, swapchain, memory allocator (VMA)
   cmd.c       frames in flight: the command buffer being recorded, staging and readback rings, deferred destruction
   format.c    guest render target and texture formats -> Vulkan formats
   surface.c   render targets by guest address (a table textures share), loads from and write-backs to guest memory
   writeback.c landing compute and graphics storage results in guest memory
   texture.c   textures from the guest's texture headers (TIC), views and samplers (TSC)
   astc.c      compute decoding of ASTC texture blocks during upload
   buffer.c    vertex, index, constant and storage buffers from guest memory
   pipeline.c  translated shaders, the pipeline layout and pipelines by state
   render.c    the render target set (dynamic rendering), clears and draws
   compute.c   compute dispatches (on a queue of their own when there is one), landing their results in guest memory
   renderer.c  the renderer interface the GPU front end calls (gpu/renderer.h) and presenting
   renderdoc.c RenderDoc captures of chosen frames (SNX_RENDERDOC)
   ui.c        the on-screen controls and the game's menu, drawn over the swapchain image
   vma.cpp     VulkanMemoryAllocator's implementation

   Everything that records commands runs under vk_lock(), which is reentrant: submits and presents come from the GPU
   thread (gpu/gpu.c, hle/services/vi.c's present_queued), the menu's refresh from the main thread, and compute results
   land on whichever thread reads their memory first. */
